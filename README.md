# CNESEmu
Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator.<br>
Written to be a learning tool, some characteristics may be less desirable<br>
than other, more performance-conscious or high-fidelity implementations.<br><br>
Thanks to:<br>
- [NESDev.org](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/) for all the invaluable information<br>
- [Yi Zhang](https://github.com/yizhang82) for their wonderful blog on the topic that inspired me to write this.<br><br>

You may do whatever you want with the code, but if you feel so inclined, <br>
a mention and link to my GitHub page works fine.
